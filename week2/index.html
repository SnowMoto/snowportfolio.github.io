        <li>What is Programming?</li>
        <p>Using a series of coding for the computer to perform tasks. Computers speak different languages, there are 3
            languages:<br>
            * Low-Level Programming Language - this is written in machine code and assembly language. This is working
            with the hardware
            invovling abstract coding that is connected to the computer architecture.<br>
            * High-Level Programming Language- written language in C, C++ and Java that then compile into machine code
            and executed. These languages
            are very fast and ideal for writing games, professional business software and most apps.<br>
            * Scripting Language - also high-level but interpreted (translate into machine code at run time).
            This is slower than compiled languages, but it has grown and making difficult to see difference between
            compiled and interpreted
            languages.
        </p>
        <li>What is Javasript?</li>
        <p> -It is a high-level scripting language that is both interpreted and compiled at run time.<br>
            -It is the web language. Nearly all browsers can run JavaScript, but it is tricky language to grasp.<br>
            -There are different features unique to the program and terms. With the dynamic
            languages programs can change while running and changes in the background.<br>
            -ex. User typing in information and in the background, JavaScript can check the typing.
