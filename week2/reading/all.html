        <h2>Ch 3: Array, Logic and Loops</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrays?</li>
            <p>-Ordered lists of values using [] brackets. These are not primitive values, but built in objects.
                -ex.const myArray = [];
                -ex.const myArray = new Array (); -array construction function.
                -Arrays have positions/index where you can access certain vaules. These positions/index start with
                [0, 1, 2, 3, 4...]. If the element in the array is empty, it will return undefined.<br>
                -Adding values ex. heroes [0] = 'Batman'; heroes[1] = 'Wonder Woman'; heroes[2] = 'Flash'; heroes[5] =
                'Aquaman';<br>
                Array Complete: heroes; return: ['Batman', 'Wonderwoman', 'Flash', undefined, undefined, 'Aquaman'] -
                undefined fills
                in the empty index.<br>
                -ex. If not wanting to assgin to certain index, then can write it out as a whole and not
                individually.<br>
                const avengers = ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Black Widow'];<br>
                -Removing values from array is by using the delete operator.
                -ex. delete avengers [3]; return: ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'undefined', 'Black Widow'] -
                Hulk was
                removed from the array.<br>
                -Array properties are great way to find the length of the array and to find certain items with in
                it.<br>
                -ex. avengers.legnth; return: 6. This will find last item: avengers[anvengers.length - 1]; returns:
                'Black Widow'.<br>
                -4 Array terms to know and how to use.<br>
                1. Pop - removes last item: anvengers.pop(); return:'Black Widow'. <br>
                2. Shift - removes first item: avengers.shift(); returns: 'Captain America'.<br>
                3. Push - appends new value to the end of the array: avengers.push('Black Widow');
                4. Unshift - appends new value to the beginning of the array: avengers.unshift('Captain American');
                -Merge Arrays is done when there are more than 2 similar arrays. Use concat() function or spread
                opperator which uses
                3 dots (...).<br>
                -ex. avengers = avengers.concat([array]);<br>
                -ex. avengers = [...avengers, ...[array] ];<br>
                -If you wish to not do an array, can us the join() method to turn the array into strings.<br>
                -ex. avengers.join(); return: 'Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow'.<br>
                -Slicing method creates subarrays to seperate certain items.<br>
                -ex. avengers.slice(2,4); returns: ["Thor", "Hulk"].<br>
                -Splicing method removes items from the array and replaces with new item.<br>
                -ex. avengers.splice(3,1, 'Scarlet Witch'); return: removes ["Hulk"], replace ["Scarlet Witch"].<br>
                -Other fun terms that can be used are reverse() to reverse the order in array, and sort() to make
                the array be in alphabetical order.<br>
                -Sets are used to add data and check data for duplicates. If you enter data that already exists then it
                ill be ignored.
                -ex. const list = new Set(); list.add(1); return = Set: {1} etc.
                -ex. const list = new Set('Hello'); return = Set: {'H', 'e', 'l', 'o'}. - note L is used already and
                function ignores the 2nd L.
            </p>
            <li>Memory Leak?</li>
            <p>-It is when the data is full and any values entered cannot be retained. The memory is being used to store
                values that are no longer
                required by the program, which wastes system resources.<br>
                -Garbage collection/WeakSet - used to to auto remove items from the memory that are no long needed for
                the program. Only non-primitive data
                can be added to the WeakSet. FYI C++ storage is only manually removed by programer.<br>
                -ex. const weak = new WeakSet();const array = [1,2,3]; weak.add(array); returns WeakSet {}.<br>
                test it out: weak.has(array) = true; weak.delet(array); = true, weak.has(array) = false. <---Array has
                    been removed.<br>
            </p>
            <li>Logic?</li>
            <p>
                -It allow control over the flow of the program. Using If () or else() statements.<br>
                -ex.if (conditio) { code to run if condition is true.} else {code to run if condition is false.}<br>
                -ex. const n = 12; if (n%2 === 0) {console.log ('n is an even number');} else {console.log('n is an odd
                number');} return = 'n is an even number'.<br>
                -The short hand way of writing if / else statments is using the terney operator of ?, but need to use 3
                operands.<br>
                -ex. const n=5; n%2 === 0 ? console.log('n is an even number') : console.log('n is an odd number');
                return = 'n is an odd number'.<br>
                -Switch statment is handy when you have many strings of if / else statements. Make it easier to follow
                testing.<br>
                -ex. switch(use a key case word for the value. ex. 'numbers');<br>
            </p>
            <li>Loops?</li>
            <p>
                -Used to run a code block to a certain condition. There are 5 loops:<br>
                1. While Loop - let bottles = 10; while(bottles > 0){console.log('There were ${bottles} green bottles,
                hanging on a wall.'); bottles--;}.<br>
                2. Infinite Loop - this happens when a loops condition doesnt get met and get stuck in a loop, which can
                crash the system.<br>
                -ex. let n=1; while(n>0){console.log('Hello'); n++;} ---n will always be greater than 0.<br>
                3. Do...While Loops - similar to while loop but the condition comes after the block.<br>
                -ex. let bottles = 10; do{console.log('There were ${bottles} green bottles, hanging on the wall.');
                bottles--;} while (bottles > 0).<br>
                4. For Loop - most commonly used in coding. the code runs before the loops starts and then initializes
                the variables use in the loop.
                The condition has to be met for the loop to continue and after the code is it wil do next after each run
                through the loop.<br>
                -ex. for (let bottlws = 10; bottles > 0; bottles--){console.log('There were ${bottles} green bottles,
                hanging on the wall.');}<br>
                5. Nested for Loops - placeing loops inside another loop. Runs the inner loop first before going through
                the outerloop.
