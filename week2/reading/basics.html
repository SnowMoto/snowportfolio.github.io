        <h2>Ch 2:Programming Basics </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What is Programming?</li>
            <p>Using a series of coding for the computer to perform tasks. Computers speak different languages, there
                are 3
                languages:<br>
                * Low-Level Programming Language - this is written in machine code and assembly language. This is
                working
                with the hardware
                invovling abstract coding that is connected to the computer architecture.<br>
                * High-Level Programming Language- written language in C, C++ and Java that then compile into machine
                code
                and executed. These languages
                are very fast and ideal for writing games, professional business software and most apps.<br>
                * Scripting Language - also high-level but interpreted (translate into machine code at run time).
                This is slower than compiled languages, but it has grown and making difficult to see difference between
                compiled and interpreted
                languages.
            </p>
            <li>What is Javasript?</li>
            <p> -It is a high-level scripting language that is both interpreted and compiled at run time.<br>
                -It is the web language. Nearly all browsers can run JavaScript, but it is tricky language to grasp.<br>
                -There are different features unique to the program and terms. With the dynamic
                languages programs can change while running and changes in the background.<br>
                -ex. User typing in information and in the background, JavaScript can check the typing.<br>
                -There are 3 key words to not use as variables; NaN, infinity and undifined. These are used by Java as
                values
                for when your code does not work right.<br>
                -There are 6 primitive data types used in coding. Any values that are not primitive data becomes an
                object.<br><br>
                1. String = typeof "hello" - provides information<br>
                2. Number = typeof 10 - provides information<br>
                3. Boolean = typeof true - values are either true of false. Logical operators can be used to check
                compound
                statements
                are true or false. <br>
                4. Symbols = ^, &&, ||, ! - unique values.<br>
                5. Undefined = indicates absence of the variable.<br>
                6. Null = 10 + null; - behaves like a 0, answer would be 10.<br><br>
                -Non-Primitive:<br>
                1. Object= typeof { ninja: "turtle"}<br>
                2. Array = typeof [1, 2, 3]<br>
                3 Function = function meWantMore(),<br><br>
                -Operator applies opperation to a value (operand) and a unary operator only requires operand;
                ex.typeof (operator) "Hello" (string/operand).<br>
                -Binary operator needs 2 operands; ex. 3 (operand) + (operator) 5 (operand).
                Ternary operator needs 3 operands.
                -Variable is used in programing to refer the value stored in the memory.<br>
                -Values can compare to see if greater, equal than or less than other values.<br>
                -Variables and values are assigned to one another using =.<br>
                -Logical operators = used in primitive value or objects to determine whether the values are
                truthy or falsy. There are 3 main types:<br>
                1. !(Logical NOT) - ! infront of a value turns in Boolean and returns opposite value. <br>
                -ex. !true; = false (negating true returns false), !0; = true - 0 is falsy and negating it returns
                true.<br>
                **Shortcut - using 2 !! will find out if the value is truthy or falsy.<br>
                2. &&(Logical AND) - logical AND condition. Works on 2 or more values and only show true.<br>
                -ex. Wearing shoes and over 18 = "shoes" && 18; - both true<br>
                -ex. Wearing shoes and over 18 = "shoes" && 0; - 0 bc it is false.<br>
                3. || (Logical OR) - only need to have 1 value be true.<br>
                -ex. Wearing shoes OR over 18 = "shoes" || 0; shoes is the value that is true.<br>
                -ex. NaN || undefined; both are falsy and returns undifined.<br>
                - ^ symbol gets confusing on how to use it. It is NOT USED to notate exponents.This is used on
                non-integers
                to evaluate to 1 operand true or 0 if both operands are true or false.<br>
                -.ex. 1 ^ o; = true / true ^ true; = false.
